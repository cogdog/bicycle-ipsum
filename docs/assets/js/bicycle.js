"'You're never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours, day after day?' said Miss Howe of the Costume Department." ,
"'I am,' said Hoopdriver as calmly as possible, pulling at the insufficient moustache. 'I'm going for a Cycling Tour. Along the South Coast.'" ,
"'Well, all I hope, Mr. Hoopdriver, is that you'll get fine weather,' said Miss Howe. 'And not come any nasty croppers.'" ,
"He left the supper table early, so that he might put in a good hour at the desperate gymnastics up the Roehampton Road before it would be time to come back for locking up. " ,
"When the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed, rubbing arnica into his knee—a new and very big place—and studying a Road Map of the South of England." ,
"'Avoid running over dogs, Hoopdriver, whatever you do.'" ,
"'Never let the machine buckle—there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling—don’t scorch, don’t ride on the foot-path, keep your own side of the road, and if you see a tramline, go round the corner at once, and hurry off into the next county—and always light up before dark.'" ,
"Only those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all the year round, save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time, know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. " ,
"All the dreary, uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall about your feet." ,
"There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney Heath. " ,
"The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass." ,
"He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill, and his heart sang within him. " ,
"Halfway up, a dissipated-looking black cat rushed home across the road and vanished under a gate. " ,
"There is only one phrase to describe his course at this stage, and that is—voluptuous curves. " ,
"He did not ride fast, he did not ride straight, an exacting critic might say he did not ride well—but he rode generously, opulently, using the whole road and even nibbling at the footpath. " ,
"The excitement never flagged. " ,
"So far he had never passed or been passed by anything, but as yet the day was young and the road was clear. " ,
"He doubted his steering so much that, for the present, he had resolved to dismount at the approach of anything else upon wheels. " ,
"The shadows of the trees lay very long and blue across the road, the morning sunlight was like amber fire." ,
"At the cross-roads at the top of West Hill, where the cattle trough stands, he turned towards Kingston and set himself to scale the little bit of ascent. " ,
"An early heath-keeper, in his velveteen jacket, marvelled at his efforts. " ,
"And while he yet struggled, the head of a carter rose over the brow." ,
"He tightened the brake, and the machine stopped dead. " ,
"He was trying to think what he did with his right leg whilst getting off. " ,
"He gripped the handles and released the brake, standing on the left pedal and waving his right foot in the air. " ,
"Then—these things take so long in the telling—he found the machine was falling over to the right. While he was deciding upon a plan of action, gravitation appears to have been busy." ,
"The handle was twisted askew again. " ,
"He would have to unscrew the beastly thing." ,
"'They’re trying things, them bicycles,' said the heath-keeper, charitably. " ,
"Then with the air of one who has delivered an ultimatum, he began replacing the screw hammer in the wallet." ,
"To ride a bicycle properly is very like a love affair—chiefly it is a matter of faith. " ,
"Believe you do it, and the thing is done; doubt, and, for the life of you, you cannot." ,
"Now you may perhaps imagine that as he rode on, his feelings towards the heath-keeper were either vindictive or remorseful, —vindictive for the aggravation or remorseful for his own injudicious display of ill temper. " ,
"As a matter of fact, they were nothing of the sort. " ,
"A sudden, a wonderful gratitude, possessed him." ,
"At the crest of the hill he put his feet upon the footrests, and now riding moderately straight, went, with a palpitating brake, down that excellent descent. " ,
"A new delight was in his eyes, quite over and above the pleasure of rushing through the keen, sweet, morning air. " ,
"He reached out his thumb and twanged his bell out of sheer happiness." ,
"A white dog came out of one of the houses and yelped at him. " ,
"He got off, rather breathless, at the foot of Kingston Hill, and pushed up. " ,
"Halfway up, an early milk chariot rattled by him; two dirty men with bundles came hurrying down. " ,
"Whoop for Freedom and Adventure! " ,
"Every now and then a house with an expression of sleepy surprise would open its eye as he passed, and to the right of him for a mile or so the weltering Thames flashed and glittered. " ,
"Talk of your joie de vivre. " ,
"Albeit with a certain cramping sensation about the knees and calves slowly forcing itself upon his attention." ,
"The Young Lady in Grey was also riding a bicycle. " ,
"She was dressed in a beautiful bluish-gray, and the sun behind her drew her outline in gold and left the rest in shadow." ,
"Strange doubts possessed him as to the nature of her nether costume. " ,
"He had heard of such things of course. French, perhaps. " ,
"Her handles glittered; a jet of sunlight splashed off her bell blindingly. " ,
"She was approaching the high road along an affluent from the villas of Surbiton. " ,
"She was travelling at about the same pace. " ,
"The appearances pointed to a meeting at the fork of the roads." ,
"By contrast with her he rode disgracefully. " ,
"Had he not better get off at once and pretend something was wrong with his treadle?" ,
"If only one could take one’s hands off the handles, one might pass with a silent elevation of the hat, of course. " ,
"But even that was a little suggestive of a funeral." ,
"Meanwhile the roads converged. " ,
"He jerked against some tin thing on the road, and it flew up between front wheel and mud-guard. " ,
"He twisted round towards her. " ,
"Had the machine a devil?" ,
"At that supreme moment it came across him that he would have done wiser to dismount. " ,
"He gave a frantic ‘whoop’ and tried to get round, then, as he seemed falling over, he pulled the handles straight again and to the left by an instinctive motion, and shot behind her hind wheel, missing her by a hair’s breadth. " ,
"He tried to recover, and found himself jumped up on the pavement and riding squarely at a neat wooden paling. " ,
"He struck this with a terrific impact and shot forward off his saddle into a clumsy entanglement. Then he began to tumble over sideways, and completed the entire figure in a sitting position on the gravel, with his feet between the fork and the stay of the machine. " ,
"The concussion on the gravel shook his entire being. " ,
"He remained in that position, wishing that he had broken his neck, wishing even more heartily that he had never been born. " ,
"The glory of life had departed." ,
"There was a soft whirr, the click of a brake, two footfalls, and the Young Lady in Grey stood holding her machine. " ,
"She had turned round and come back to him. " ,
"'Machine all right?' she asked, looking past him at the prostrate vehicle, her hands on her handle-bar." ,
"At that he rushed his machine into the road, and began a hasty ascent." ,
"He pushed at the pedals with archaic violence. " ,
"So Palaeolithic man may have ridden his simple bicycle of chipped flint in pursuit of his exogamous affinity. " ,
"She vanished round the corner. " ,
"His effort was Titanic. " ,
"What should he say when he overtook her?" ,
"The road was certainly a bit uphill. " ,
"He turned the corner and saw a long stretch of road, and a grey dress vanishing. " ,
"He got off unsteadily, and for a moment his legs felt like wisps of cotton. " ,
"He balanced his machine against the grassy edge of the path and sat down panting. " ,
"His hands were gnarled with swollen veins and shaking palpably, his breath came viscid." ,
"'I'm hardly in training yet,' he remarked. " ,
"His legs had gone leaden. " ,
"'I don't feel as though I'd had a mouthful of breakfast.'" ,
"There was a noise of a foot spurning the gravel. " ,
"He had already gathered pace. " ,
"He pedalled with ill-suppressed anger, and his head was going down. " ,
"In another moment he flew swiftly out of sight under the railway arch." ,
"He was pleased to find his command over his machine already sensibly increased. " ,
"He set himself little exercises as he went along and performed them with variable success. There was, for instance, steering in between a couple of stones, say a foot apart, a deed of little difficulty as far as the front wheel is concerned. " ,
"But the back wheel, not being under the sway of the human eye, is apt to take a vicious jump over the obstacle, which sends a violent concussion all along the spine to the skull, and will even jerk a loosely fastened hat over the eyes, and so lead to much confusion. " ,
"And again, there was taking the hand or hands off the handlebar, a thing simple in itself, but complex in its consequences." ,
"Until the cyclist can steer with one hand, his face is given over to Beelzebub." ,
"He presently attained sufficient dexterity to slap himself smartly and violently in the face with his right hand, without certainly overturning the machine; but his pocket handkerchief might have been in California for any good it was to him while he was in the saddle." ,
"And once he almost ran over something wonderful, a little, low, red beast with a yellowish tail, that went rushing across the road before him." ,
"There were miles of this, scores of miles of this before him, pinewood and oak forest, purple, heathery moorland and grassy down, lush meadows, where shining rivers wound their lazy way, villages with square-towered, flint churches, and rambling, cheap, and hearty inns, clean, white, country towns, long downhill stretches, where one might ride at one’s ease (overlooking a jolt or so), and far away, at the end of it all,— the sea." ,
"What mattered a fly or so in the dawn of these delights? " ,
"The other cyclist in brown had a machine of dazzling newness, and a punctured pneumatic lay across his knees." ,
"He rode his straightest, and kept his pedals spinning, albeit a limp numbness had resumed possession of his legs." ,
"But he kept on and drew nearer and nearer, breathing hard and gathering flies like a flypaper. " ,
"In the valley he was hidden. " ,
"Then the road began to rise, and the resistance of the pedals grew. " ,
"He gripped the brake. " ,
"Steady! " ,
"His right leg waved in the air, and he came down heavily and staggering, but erect. " ,
"But the ill-concealed bladery of the machine, the present machinery of Fate, the deus ex machina, so to speak, was against him. " ,
"The bicycle, torn from this attractive young woman, grew heavier and heavier, and continually more unsteady. " ,
"It seemed a choice between stopping at Ripley or dying in the flower of his days. " ,
"He went into the Unicorn, after propping his machine outside the door." ,
"In his little cyclist hand-book there is a diary, and in the diary there is an entry of these things— it is there to this day, and I cannot do better than reproduce it here to witness that this book is indeed a true one, and no lying fable written to while away an hour." ,
"At last he fell a-yawning so much that very reluctantly indeed he set about finishing this great and splendid day. " ,
"(Alas! that all days must end at last!)" ,
"After your first day of cycling one dream is inevitable. " ,
"A memory of motion lingers in the muscles of your legs, and round and round they seem to go. " ,
"You ride through Dreamland on wonderful dream bicycles that change and grow; you ride down steeples and staircases and over precipices; you hover in horrible suspense over inhabited towns, vainly seeking for a brake your hand cannot find, to save you from a headlong fall; you plunge into weltering rivers, and rush helplessly at monstrous obstacles." ,
"He dared not look round. " ,
"Where the devil was the brake? " ,
"It must have fallen off. " ,
"And the bell?" ,
"He tried to shout and warn the town to get out of the way, but his voice was gone as well." ,
"Nearer, nearer!" ,
"Along this pleasant shady way he felt sufficiently secure to resume his exercises in riding with one hand off the handles, and in staring over his shoulder. " ,
"He came over once or twice, but fell on his foot each time, and perceived that he was improving." ,
"Sometimes he could hear their pneumatics stealing upon him from behind, and looking round saw a long stretch of vacant road. " ,
"Once he saw far ahead of him a glittering wheel, but it proved to be a workingman riding to destruction on a very tall ordinary. " ,
"The bicycles were lying by the roadside, and the two riders stood face to face." ,
"He grasped his brake, descended, and stood looking hesitatingly back." ,
"The sun shone, and the wide blue hill views and pleasant valleys one saw on either hand from the sandscarred roadway, even the sides of the road itself set about with grey heather scrub and prickly masses of gorse, and pine trees with their year’s growth still bright green, against the darkened needles of the previous years, were fresh and delightful." ,
"One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. " ,
"In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. " ,
"Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so." ,
"Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings—those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust—and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. " ,
"He put his screw hammer into his pocket and walked through the archway into the street, to settle the business forthwith, for he prided himself on his decision. " ,
"The bicycle, cap-a-pie, occupied, under protest, a strategic position in the shop. " ,
"He was expectant by six in the morning. " ,
"By nine horrible fears oppressed him that his quest had escaped him, and he had to reconnoitre the Angel yard in order to satisfy himself." ,
"He grew hot indeed, and his knees were a little stiff to begin with, but that was all." ,
"It might take them twenty minutes to mount that. " ,
"Beyond was empty downland perhaps for miles. " ,
"He decided to return to the inn and snatch a hasty meal." ,
"That was a comforting reflection. " ,
"It not only justified a slow progress up the hill, but at the crest a sprawl on the turf beside the road, to contemplate the Weald from the south. In a matter of two days he had crossed that spacious valley, with its frozen surge of green hills, its little villages and townships here and there, its copses and cornfields, its ponds and streams like jewelery of diamonds and silver glittering in the sun. " ,
"Overhead an anxious peewit circled against the blue, and every now and then emitted its feeble cry." ,
"Up here the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze. " ,
"He mounted and rode as rapidly as the heat and a lingering lassitude permitted. " ,
"Now and then he had to dismount to examine the surface where the road forked. " ,
"He enjoyed that rather." ,
"Here was moonlight rising over the memory of a red sunset, dark shadows and glowing orange lamps, beauty somewhere mysteriously rapt away from him, tangible wrong in a brown suit and an unpleasant face, flouting him." ,
"'Get your bicycle out in the road?'" ,
"He had to get those bicycles." ,
"And so the twenty minutes' law passed into an infinity. " ,
"The night was a warm white silence save for the subtile running of their chains. " ,
"He looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankles gracefully ruling the treadles. " ,
"Now the road turned westward, and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon; and now they faced northwards, and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek." ,
"There is a magic quality in moonshine; it touches all that is sweet and beautiful, and the rest of the night is hidden. " ,
"It has created the fairies, whom the sunlight kills, and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it, the voices of the filmy route, and their faint, soul-piercing melodies. " ,
"By the moonlight every man, dull clod though he be by day, tastes something of Endymion, takes something of the youth and strength of Enidymion." ,
"The firm substantial daylight things become ghostly and elusive, the hills beyond are a sea of unsubstantial texture, the world a visible spirit, the spiritual within us rises out of its darkness, loses something of its weight and body, and swims up towards heaven. " ,
"This road that was a mere rutted white dust, hot underfoot, blinding to the eye, is now a soft grey silence, with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there. " ,
"Overhead, riding serenely through the spacious blue, is the mother of the silence, she who has spiritualised the world, alone save for two attendant steady shining stars. " ,
"And in silence under her benign influence, under the benediction of her light, rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night." ,
"Stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side." ,
"'Where are we?'" ,
"'Are you tired?' he asked." ,
"They rode with a streaky, grey sea coming and going on their left hand."
